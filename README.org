#+title: julia_cuda_shell
Provides a nix shell that allows you to run Julia on the GPU
* Usage
Use direnv or ~nix develop~ once you're in the directory
* Setup
- Use a local CUDA as in https://cuda.juliagpu.org/stable/installation/overview/#Using-a-local-CUDA
* Limitations
- Only Julia 1.9 works---Julia 1.10 complains about missing a library when installing Flux; this may be fixable
